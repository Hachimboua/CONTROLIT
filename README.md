# CONTROLIT: Hand Gesture Slideshow System üë®‚Äçüè´

**CONTROLIT** offers a secure, intuitive, and real-time way for a professor to control slideshow presentations using only hand gestures. The system combines advanced computer vision techniques‚Äî**face recognition** for authentication and **MediaPipe** for pose and hand tracking‚Äîto deliver a seamless, gesture-controlled experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **üßë‚Äçüè´ Professor Authentication**  
  Ensures that only the authorized professor can control the slideshow using face recognition.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Optimized Pose Tracking**  
  MediaPipe Pose is applied selectively to a Region of Interest (ROI) around the professor‚Äôs face, reducing computation and preventing interference.

- **üìç Adaptive Hand ROI**  
  Hand detection focuses dynamically around the professor‚Äôs wrists, adapting to their distance from the camera.

- **‚ö° Efficient Processing**  
  Face recognition runs on downscaled frames and less frequently once authentication is confirmed.

- **üéöÔ∏è Adjustable Face Tolerance**  
  Recognition strictness adjusts based on recent detection confidence history.

- **‚úã Gesture Cooldown**  
  Prevents rapid repeat execution of the same command.

- **üñêÔ∏è Single-Hand Processing**  
  Explicitly processes gestures from only one hand (right arm only for better consistency).

- **üêõ Enhanced Debugging**  
  Visual debug overlays and detailed terminal output assist in system troubleshooting.

- **üìä Data Collection Mode**  
  Built-in data logger makes it easy to collect training data for new gestures.
